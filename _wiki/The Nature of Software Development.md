# Introduction

> If there is a path - and I hpe to show you that there is - **we will wander off of it. Yes, we will.**

> What we can do is remain awre that there is a path.

# Chpater 2 Value Is What We Want

> What kinds of value does your project delier to its user? **To your organization? To the tema? What value does it deliver to you?**

# Chapter 5 Planning Feature by Feature

### Planning is indispendable. 
> Plans are useless, but planing is indispensable.

> We do need to plan. We don't need a detailed list of what will happen and when.

> It's important to identify key features that we'll need to have early, as well as features we can't live without.
> We need to defer implementing low-value iedas indefinitely.

> So let's do plan but at the same time stay loose andready for change.

### Detailed plans are useless.
> Well, yes, software people are terrible at estimating, because humans are terrible at estimating.
> Let's not just try harder. Let's find a better way.

책에서 추천하는 것은각 일감이 언제 끝날 지 estimation하는 것이 아니라, 정해진 기간과 예산 안에서 얼마나 많은 일을 끝낼 수 있는 지 estimation하는 것이다.


### How much work should the team take on?
> The point isn't to make good estimates - **the point is to do good work aat a consistent pacs.**


### Estimation is risky! 
> We have an almost irresistible desire to imprive them, or to compare them.
> Keep in mind that business and management get the best results by selecting the work to be done and the work to be deferred.


### Planning with "stretch goals" is destructuve.
> During planning, especially short-term planning, it's tempting to set up "stretch goals" or to "encourage" the team to do "just one more feature."
> Hurrying, they'll inject more defects.

# Chapture 6 Building the Product, Feature by Feature

### Build a tiny product, completely, in each small cycle.

### Refine the product vision.
> We need to sharpen our vision of what the product must do - and what's just "nice to have."

### Eliminate the test-and-fix finish.
> For feature-by-featyre development to work, the software needs to be nearly free of defects at the end of every two-week iteration
> To be sure we're free of defects, we need to check everything, all the time.

--- 

# Chapture 7 Buld Features and Foundation in Parallel

### Refine each feature in multiple iterations.
> **We can repeat the in every iteration, making priority decisions as we go, until time and money tell us that it's time to stop or switch attention to a new product.**

# Chapture 8 Bug-Free and Well Designed

### Defect repair adds unknown delay. Repair as you go to provide clarity on what's done.
> no one sees a roach on the floor of a restaurant and says "There goes the roach/" It's the smae with bug

### If we don't know in the wats' done, and how well it's done, wei;; have no choice but to ship late with visible defects. That's bad business.
> **"Bug triage?" No, thanks.**

### At the end of every iteration, we need business-level tests to verify that we have received what we asked for.
> We need to know whether the new ones work, and we need to be sure that old ones haven't broken.

### Failure to keep the design good enough will slow progress, or even stop it!
> Testing and refactoring work together to make feature-by-feature development possible.

--- 

### Chapter 10 Value -- What is it?
> **If we are to survive as a company or individuals, we need to look deeply at value, and to choose the things that matter, among all the things we might do.**
> Choosing value is choosing what matters to you.
> Value ... is what you want.

### Chapter 14 Creating Teams That Thrive
> In some teams, the Product Champion brings in defined solutions rather than concerns or problems. This can work but it's far from ideal.
> Your team will be slower to gain a sense of purpose if they are spoon-fed solutions rather than being allowed to creatively slove problems.
