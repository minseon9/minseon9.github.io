I'm Minseong Lee, also known as Ian. I've been working as a backend engineer since 2021, primarily in B2B SaaS—blockchain infrastructure and HR products.

If you want to know more about my professional life as a backend engineer, you can check my [LinkedIn]({{ page.linkedin }}) profile or [Resume](/assets/career/résumé.pdf).

This site is where I document my personal records, projects, and what I've learned. I write here because I want to share, discuss, and sometimes revise my thoughts with others.

##### Values

I find happiness in small things. Happiness isn't far away—it's in a delicious lunch, the sunlight sparkling on my way back from the restaurant. I pursue a life where I can fully savor these simple joys.

When making decisions, asking "why" comes first, and I take full responsibility for my choices—this is what I've learned and practiced since childhood. Most of the time, life calls for collaboration—I listen, accept, and discuss. In those rare moments when it doesn't, I prioritize what I feel and need, trusting my instincts over external standards or trends.

I'm an individualist. Just as I exist as an individual, I respect others as individuals. Like how Snorlax is respected as a great presence in Pokémon, even if all it does is sleep. 💤

##### When I'm Away from the Computer

I'm a plant parent. I've been growing five different species for over three years, starting with an olive tree.

I try to start my day by checking on my plants. Taking care of them is the same as taking care of myself. To enjoy what I love for a long time, I believe in nurturing myself. That's the spirit I bring to caring for my green friends.
