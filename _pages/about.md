I'm Minseong Lee, also known as Ian. I've been working as a backend engineer since 2021, primarily in B2B SaaSâ€”blockchain infrastructure and HR products.

If you want to know more about my professional life as a backend engineer, you can check my [LinkedIn]({{ page.linkedin }}) profile.

This site is where I document my personal records, projects, and what I've learned. I write here because I want to share, discuss, and sometimes revise my thoughts with others.

##### Values

I find happiness in small things. Happiness isn't far awayâ€”it's in a delicious lunch, the sunlight sparkling on my way back from the restaurant. I pursue a life where I can fully savor these simple joys.

When making decisions, asking "why" comes first, and I take full responsibility for my choicesâ€”this is what I've learned and practiced since childhood. Most of the time, life calls for collaborationâ€”I listen, accept, and discuss. In those rare moments when it doesn't, I prioritize what I feel and need, trusting my instincts over external standards or trends.

I'm an individualist. Just as I exist as an individual, I respect others as individuals. Like how Snorlax is respected as a great presence in PokÃ©mon, even if all it does is sleep. ðŸ’¤

##### When I'm Away from the Computer

I'm a plant parent. I've been growing five different species for over three years, starting with an olive tree.

I try to start my day by checking on my plants. Taking care of them is the same as taking care of myself. To enjoy what I love for a long time, I believe in nurturing myself. That's the spirit I bring to caring for my green friends.
