## Tmpfs
[Tmpfs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/tmpfs.html) is a **file system which keeps all of its files in virtual memory.**  

Tmpfs builds on top of `ramfs`.  
While `ramfs` can grow without bounds and consume all available memory, tmpfs introduces size limits and memory management.  

Even with these safeguards, when `/tmp` is backed by tmpfs, its usable size is generally far more limited than disk-backed storage, making it risky for handling large temporary files.  

### /tmp is now tmpfs

As noted in the [Amazon Linux 2023 release notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/linux/al2023/ug/compare-al2-al2023-tmp.html Amazon Linux 2023 - /tmp changes), /tmp is now implemented as tmpfs instead of a disk-backed directory.
